For the proper using of the tool and to ensure that the provided information is accurate, it is recommended to follow some best practices. 
Firstly, objects should be added to the corresponding transportation request for the development, regardless of whether they can be locked or not. 

Secondly, if an object is locked in a transportation order, any user making modifications will add a new task to that request. Users not making changes for the project identified in the request should delete these tasks and manually add the objects to their own transportation requests.
Following both best premises, it can be stated as follows: *A transportation request should reference a single development or project*. *All objects contained in that request will correspond to changes related to that development or project*.

Another best practice that facilitates code comparisons is to tag changes with an identifier for the referenced project, the user, and the date of the change. The identifier for the referenced project should be also in the Transport Request description.
